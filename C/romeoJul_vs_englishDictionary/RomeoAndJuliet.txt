entire play
act i


 prologue

 two households both alike in dignity
 in fair verona where we lay our scene
 from ancient grudge break to new mutiny
 where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
 from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
 a pair of starcrossd lovers take their life
 whose misadventured piteous overthrows
 do with their death bury their parents strife
 the fearful passage of their deathmarkd love
 and the continuance of their parents rage
 which but their childrens end nought could remove
 is now the two hours traffic of our stage
 the which if you with patient ears attend
 what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend

 swords and bucklers

 that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
 with purple fountains issuing from your veins
 on pain of torture from those bloody hands
 throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground
 and hear the sentence of your moved prince
 three civil brawls bred of an airy word
 by thee old capulet and montague
 have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets
 and made veronas ancient citizens
 cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
 to wield old partisans in hands as old
 cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate
 if ever you disturb our streets again
 your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
 for this time all the rest depart away
 you capulet shall go along with me
 and montague come you this afternoon
 to know our further pleasure in this case

montague

 who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
 speak nephew were you by when it began

benvolio

 here were the servants of your adversary
 and yours close fighting ere i did approach
 i drew to part them in the instant came
 the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared
 which as he breathed defiance to my ears
 he swung about his head and cut the winds
 who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn
 while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
 came more and more and fought on part and part
 till the prince came who parted either part

lady montague

 o where is romeo saw you him today
 right glad i am he was not at this fray

benvolio

 madam an hour before the worshippd sun
 peerd forth the golden window of the east
 a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
 where underneath the grove of sycamore
 that westward rooteth from the citys side
 so early walking did i see your son
 towards him i made but he was ware of me
 and stole into the covert of the wood
 i measuring his affections by my own
 that most are busied when theyre most alone
 pursued my humour not pursuing his
 and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me

montague

 many a morning hath he there been seen
 with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
 adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
 but all so soon as the allcheering sun
 should in the furthest east begin to draw
 the shady curtains from auroras bed
 away from the light steals home my heavy son
 and private in his chamber pens himself
 shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
 and makes himself an artificial night
 black and portentous must this humour prove
 unless good counsel may the cause remove

benvolio

 my noble uncle do you know the cause

montague

 i neither know it nor can learn of him

benvolio

 have you importuned him by any means

montague

 both by myself and many other friends
 but he his own affections counsellor
 is to himselfi will not say how true
 but to himself so secret and so close
 so far from sounding and discovery
 as is the bud bit with an envious worm
 ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
 or dedicate his beauty to the sun
 could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
 we would as willingly give cure as know

 enter romeo

benvolio

 see where he comes so please you step aside
 ill know his grievance or be much denied

montague

 i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
 to hear true shrift come madam lets away

 exeunt montague and lady montague

benvolio

 goodmorrow cousin

romeo

benvolio

 but new struck nine

romeo

 ay me sad hours seem long
 was that my father that went hence so fast

benvolio

 it was what sadness lengthens romeos hours

romeo

 not having that which having makes them short

benvolio

 in love

romeo

 out

benvolio

 of love

romeo

 out of her favour where i am in love

benvolio

 alas that love so gentle in his view
 should be so tyrannous and rough in proof

romeo

 alas that love whose view is muffled still
 should without eyes see pathways to his will
 where shall we dine o me what fray was here
 yet tell me not for i have heard it all
 heres much to do with hate but more with love
 why then o brawling love o loving hate
 o any thing of nothing first create
 o heavy lightness serious vanity
 misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
 feather of lead bright smoke cold fire
 sick health
 stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
 this love feel i that feel no love in this
 dost thou not laugh

benvolio

 no coz i rather weep

romeo

 good heart at what

benvolio

 at thy good hearts oppression

romeo

 why such is loves transgression
 griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
 which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
 with more of thine this love that thou hast shown
 doth add more grief to too much of mine own
 love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
 being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
 being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
 what is it else a madness most discreet
 a choking gall and a preserving sweet
 farewell my coz

benvolio

 soft i will go along
 an if you leave me so you do me wrong

romeo

 tut i have lost myself i am not here
 this is not romeo hes some other where

benvolio

 tell me in sadness who is that you love

romeo

 what shall i groan and tell thee

benvolio

 groan why no
 but sadly tell me who

romeo

 bid a sick man in sadness make his will
 ah word ill urged to one that is so ill
 in sadness cousin i do love a woman

benvolio

benvolio

 a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit

romeo

 well in that hit you miss shell not be hit
 with cupids arrow she hath dians wit
 and in strong proof of chastity well armd
 from loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd
 she will not stay the siege of loving terms
 nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
 nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
 o she is rich in beauty only poor
 that when she dies with beauty dies her store

benvolio

 then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste

romeo

 she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
 for beauty starved with her severity
 cuts beauty off from all posterity
 she is too fair too wise wisely too fair
 to merit bliss by making me despair
 she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
 do i live dead that live to tell it now

benvolio

 be ruled by me forget to think of her

romeo

 o teach me how i should forget to think

benvolio

 by giving liberty unto thine eyes
 examine other beauties

romeo

 tis the way
 to call hers exquisite in question more
 these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
 being black put us in mind they hide the fair
 he that is strucken blind cannot forget
 the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
 show me a mistress that is passing fair
 what doth her beauty serve but as a note
 where i may read who passd that passing fair
 farewell thou canst not teach me to forget

benvolio

 ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt

 and see how one another lends content
 and what obscured in this fair volume lies

 this precious book of love this unbound lover
 to beautify him only lacks a cover
 the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
 for fair without the fair within to hide
 that book in manys eyes doth share the glory
 that in gold clasps locks in the golden story
 so shall you share all that he doth possess
 by having him making yourself no less

nurse

 no less nay bigger women grow by men

lady capulet

 scene iv a street

 enter romeo mercutio benvolio with five or six maskers
 torchbearers and others 

romeo

 what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
 or shall we on without a apology

benvolio

 the date is out of such prolixity
 well have no cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
 bearing a tartars painted bow of lath
 scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
 nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
 after the prompter for our entrance
 but let them measure us by what they will
 well measure them a measure and be gone

romeo

 give me a torch i am not for this ambling
 being but heavy i will bear the light

mercutio

 nay gentle romeo we must have you dance

romeo

 not i believe me you have dancing shoes
 with nimble soles i have a soul of lead
 so stakes me to the ground i cannot move

mercutio

 you are a lover borrow cupids wings
 and soar with them above a common bound

romeo

 i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
 to soar with his light feathers and so bound
 i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
 under loves heavy burden do i sink

mercutio

 and to sink in it should you burden love
 too great oppression for a tender thing

romeo

 is love a tender thing it is too rough
 too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn

mercutio

 if love be rough with you be rough with love
 prick love for pricking and you beat love down
 give me a case to put my visage in
 a visor for a visor what care i
 what curious eye doth quote deformities
 here are the beetle brows shall blush for me

benvolio

 come knock and enter and no sooner in
 but every man betake him to his legs

romeo

 a torch for me let wantons light of heart
 tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
 for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
 ill be a candleholder and look on
 the game was neer so fair and i am done

mercutio

 tut duns the mouse the constables own word
 if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
 of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst
 up to the ears come we burn daylight ho

romeo

 nay thats not so

mercutio

 i mean sir in delay
 we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
 take our good meaning for our judgment sits
 five times in that ere once in our five wits

romeo

 and we mean well in going to this mask
 but tis no wit to go

mercutio

 why may one ask

romeo

 i dreamd a dream tonight

mercutio

 and so did i

romeo

 well what was yours

mercutio

 that dreamers often lie

romeo

 in bed asleep while they do dream things true

mercutio

 o then i see queen mab hath been with you
 she is the fairies midwife and she comes
 in shape no bigger than an agatestone
 on the forefinger of an alderman
 drawn with a team of little atomies
 athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
 her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs
 the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
 the traces of the smallest spiders web
 the collars of the moonshines watery beams
 her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
 her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
 not so big as a round little worm
 prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
 her chariot is an empty hazelnut
 made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
 time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
 and in this state she gallops night by night
 through lovers brains and then they dream of love
 oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight
 oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
 oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream
 which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
 because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
 sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
 and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
 and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
 tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
 then dreams he of another benefice
 sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck
 and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
 of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
 of healths fivefathom deep and then anon
 drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
 and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
 and sleeps again this is that very mab
 that plats the manes of horses in the night
 and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
 which once untangled much misfortune bodes
 this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
 that presses them and learns them first to bear
 making them women of good carriage
 this is she

romeo

 peace peace mercutio peace
 thou talkst of nothing

mercutio

 true i talk of dreams
 which are the children of an idle brain
 begot of nothing but vain fantasy
 which is as thin of substance as the air
 and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
 even now the frozen bosom of the north
 and being angerd puffs away from thence
 turning his face to the dewdropping south

benvolio

 this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
 supper is done and we shall come too late

romeo

 i fear too early for my mind misgives
 some consequence yet hanging in the stars
 shall bitterly begin his fearful date
 with this nights revels and expire the term
 of a despised life closed in my breast
 by some vile forfeit of untimely death
 but he that hath the steerage of my course
 direct my sail on lusty gentlemen

 enrich the hand
 of yonder knight

servant

 i know not sir

romeo

 o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
 it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
 like a rich jewel in an ethiopes ear
 beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
 so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
 as yonder lady oer her fellows shows
 the measure done ill watch her place of stand
 and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
 did my heart love till now forswear it sight
 for i neer saw true beauty till this night

tybalt

 to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss

juliet

 good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
 which mannerly devotion shows in this
 for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
 and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss

romeo

 have not saints lips and holy palmers too

juliet

 ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer

 o then dear saint let lips do what hands do
 they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair

juliet

 saints do not move though grant for prayers sake

romeo

 then move not while my prayers effect i take
 thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged

juliet

chorus

 now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
 and young affection gapes to be his heir
 that fair for which love groand for and would die
 with tender juliet matchd is now not fair
 now romeo is beloved and loves again
 alike betwitched by the charm of looks
 but to his foe supposed he must complain
 and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
 being held a foe he may not have access
 to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
 and she as much in love her means much less
 to meet her newbeloved any where
 but passion lends them power time means to meet
 tempering extremities with extreme sweet

mercutio

 nay ill conjure too
 romeo humours madman passion lover
 appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
 speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied
 cry but ay me pronounce but love and dove
 speak to my gossip venus one fair word
 one nickname for her purblind son and heir
 young adam cupid he that shot so trim
 when king cophetua loved the beggarmaid
 he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
 the ape is dead and i must conjure him
 i conjure thee by rosalines bright eyes
 by her high forehead and her scarlet lip
 by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
 and the demesnes that there adjacent lie
 that in thy likeness thou appear to us

benvolio

 and if he hear thee thou wilt anger him

mercutio

 this cannot anger him twould anger him
 to raise a spirit in his mistress circle
 of some strange nature letting it there stand
 till she had laid it and conjured it down
 that were some spite my invocation
 is fair and honest and in his mistres s name
 i conjure only but to raise up him

benvolio

 come he hath hid himself among these trees
 to be consorted with the humorous night
 blind is his love and best befits the dark

mercutio

 if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
 now will he sit under a medlar tree
 and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
 as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
 romeo that she were o that she were
 an open et caetera thou a poperin pear
 romeo good night ill to my trucklebed

 scene ii capulets orchard

 enter romeo 

romeo

 he jests at scars that never felt a wound

 juliet appears above at a window

 but soft what light through yonder window breaks
 it is the east and juliet is the sun
 arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
 who is already sick and pale with grief
 that thou her maid art far more fair than she
 be not her maid since she is envious
 her vestal livery is but sick and green
 and none but fools do wear it cast it off
 it is my lady o it is my love
 o that she knew she were
 she speaks yet she says nothing what of that
 her eye discourses i will answer it
 i am too bold tis not to me she speaks
 two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
 having some business do entreat her eyes
 to twinkle in their spheres till they return
 what if her eyes were there they in her head
 the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
 as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
 would through the airy region stream so bright
 that birds would sing and think it were not night
 see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
 o that i were a glove upon that hand
 that i might touch that cheek

juliet

 ay me

romeo

 she speaks
 o speak again bright angel for thou art
 as glorious to this night being oer my head
 as is a winged messenger of heaven
 unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
 of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
 when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
 and sails upon the bosom of the air

juliet

 o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
 deny thy father and refuse thy name
 or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
 and ill no longer be a capulet

romeo

 [aside] shall i hear more or shall i speak at this

juliet

 tis but thy name that is my enemy
 thou art thyself though not a montague
 whats montague it is nor hand nor foot
 nor arm nor face nor any other part
 belonging to a man o be some other name
 whats in a name that which we call a rose
 by any other name would smell as sweet
 so romeo would were he not romeo calld
 retain that dear perfection which he owes
 without that title romeo doff thy name
 and for that name which is no part of thee
 take all myself

romeo

 i take thee at thy word
 call me but love and ill be new baptized
 henceforth i never will be romeo

juliet

 what man art thou that thus bescreend in night
 so stumblest on my counsel

romeo

 by a name
 i know not how to tell thee who i am
 my name dear saint is hateful to myself
 because it is an enemy to thee
 had i it written i would tear the word

juliet

 my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
 of that tongues utterance yet i know the sound
 art thou not romeo and a montague

romeo

 neither fair saint if either thee dislike

juliet

 how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
 the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
 and the place death considering who thou art
 if any of my kinsmen find thee here

romeo

 with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls
 for stony limits cannot hold love out
 and what love can do that dares love attempt
 therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me

juliet

 if they do see thee they will murder thee

romeo

 alack there lies more peril in thine eye
 than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
 and i am proof against their enmity

juliet

 i would not for the world they saw thee here

romeo

 i have nights cloak to hide me from their sight
 and but thou love me let them find me here
 my life were better ended by their hate
 than death prorogued wanting of thy love

juliet

 by whose direction foundst thou out this place

romeo

 by love who first did prompt me to inquire
 he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
 i am no pilot yet wert thou as far
 as that vast shore washd with the farthest sea
 i would adventure for such merchandise

juliet

 thou knowst the mask of night is on my face
 else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
 for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
 fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny
 what i have spoke but farewell compliment
 dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay
 and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst
 thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
 then say jove laughs o gentle romeo
 if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
 or if thou thinkst i am too quickly won
 ill frown and be perverse an say thee nay
 so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
 in truth fair montague i am too fond
 and therefore thou mayst think my havior light
 but trust me gentleman ill prove more true
 than those that have more cunning to be strange
 i should have been more strange i must confess
 but that thou overheardst ere i was ware
 my true loves passion therefore pardon me
 and not impute this yielding to light love
 which the dark night hath so discovered

romeo

 lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
 that tips with silver all these fruittree tops

juliet

 o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
 that monthly changes in her circled orb
 lest that thy love prove likewise variable

romeo

 what shall i swear by

juliet

 do not swear at all
 or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
 which is the god of my idolatry
 and ill believe thee

romeo

 if my hearts dear love

juliet

 well do not swear although i joy in thee
 i have no joy of this contract tonight
 it is too rash too unadvised too sudden
 too like the lightning which doth cease to be
 ere one can say it lightens sweet good night
 this bud of love by summers ripening breath
 may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
 good night good night as sweet repose and rest
 come to thy heart as that within my breast

romeo

 o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied

juliet

 what satisfaction canst thou have tonight

romeo

 the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine

juliet

 i gave thee mine before thou didst request it
 and yet i would it were to give again

romeo

 wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love

juliet

 but to be frank and give it thee again
 and yet i wish but for the thing i have
 my bounty is as boundless as the sea
 my love as deep the more i give to thee
 the more i have for both are infinite

 nurse calls within

 hist romeo hist o for a falconers voice
 to lure this tasselgentle back again
 bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
 else would i tear the cave where echo lies
 and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
 with repetition of my romeos name

romeo

 it is my soul that calls upon my name
 how silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
 like softest music to attending ears

juliet

 at what oclock tomorrow
 shall i send to thee

romeo

juliet

 i will not fail tis twenty years till then
 i have forgot why i did call thee back

romeo

 let me stand here till thou remember it

juliet

 i shall forget to have thee still stand there
 remembering how i love thy company

romeo

 and ill still stay to have thee still forget
 forgetting any other home but this

juliet

 tis almost morning i would have thee gone
 and yet no further than a wantons bird
 who lets it hop a little from her hand
 like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
 and with a silk thread plucks it back again
 so lovingjealous of his liberty

romeo

 i would i were thy bird

juliet

 sweet so would i
 yet i should kill thee with much cherishing
 good night good night parting is such
 sweet sorrow
 that i shall say good night till it be morrow

friar laurence

 the greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night
 chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
 and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
 from forth days path and titans fiery wheels
 now ere the sun advance his burning eye
 the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
 i must upfill this osier cage of ours
 with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
 the earth thats natures mother is her tomb
 what is her burying grave that is her womb
 and from her womb children of divers kind
 we sucking on her natural bosom find
 many for many virtues excellent
 none but for some and yet all different
 o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
 in herbs plants stones and their true qualities
 for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
 but to the earth some special good doth give
 nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
 revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
 virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
 and vice sometimes by action dignified
 within the infant rind of this small flower
 poison hath residence and medicine power
 for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
 being tasted slays all senses with the heart
 two such opposed kings encamp them still
 in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
 and where the worser is predominant
 full soon the canker death eats up that plant

 enter romeo

romeo

 good morrow father

friar laurence

 benedicite
 what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
 young son it argues a distemperd head
 so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
 care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
 and where care lodges sleep will never lie
 but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
 doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
 therefore thy earliness doth me assure
 thou art uproused by some distemperature
 or if not so then here i hit it right
 our romeo hath not been in bed tonight

romeo

 that last is true the sweeter rest was mine

friar laurence

 god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline

romeo

 with rosaline my ghostly father no
 i have forgot that name and that names woe

friar laurence

 thats my good son but where hast thou been then

romeo

 ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
 i have been feasting with mine enemy
 where on a sudden one hath wounded me
 thats by me wounded both our remedies
 within thy help and holy physic lies
 i bear no hatred blessed man for lo
 my intercession likewise steads my foe

friar laurence

 be plain good son and homely in thy drift
 riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

romeo

 then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
 on the fair daughter of rich capulet
 as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
 and all combined save what thou must combine
 by holy marriage when and where and how
 we met we wood and made exchange of vow
 ill tell thee as we pass but this i pray
 that thou consent to marry us today

friar laurence

 holy saint francis what a change is here
 is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
 so soon forsaken young mens love then lies
 not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
 jesu maria what a deal of brine
 hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
 how much salt water thrown away in waste
 to season love that of it doth not taste
 the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
 thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
 lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
 of an old tear that is not washd off yet
 if eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine
 thou and these woes were all for rosaline
 and art thou changed pronounce this sentence then
 women may fall when theres no strength in men

romeo

 thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline

friar laurence

 for doting not for loving pupil mine

romeo

 and badst me bury love

friar laurence

 not in a grave
 to lay one in another out to have

romeo

 i pray thee chide not she whom i love now
 doth grace for grace and love for love allow
 the other did not so

friar laurence

 o she knew well
 thy love did read by rote and could not spell
 but come young waverer come go with me
 in one respect ill thy assistant be
 for this alliance may so happy prove
 to turn your households rancour to pure love

romeo

 pardon good mercutio my business was great and in
 such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy

 inch narrow to an ell broad

 so smile the heavens upon this holy act
 that after hours with sorrow chide us not

romeo

 amen amen but come what sorrow can
 it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
 that one short minute gives me in her sight
 do thou but close our hands with holy words
 then lovedevouring death do what he dare
 it is enough i may but call her mine

friar laurence

 these violent delights have violent ends
 and in their triumph die like fire and powder
 which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
 is loathsome in his own deliciousness
 and in the taste confounds the appetite
 therefore love moderately long love doth so
 too swift arrives as tardy as too slow

 unfold the imagined happiness that both
 receive in either by this dear encounter

 enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
 upon the table and says god send me no need of

 or a hair less in his beard than thou hast thou
 wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no
 other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what
 eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
 thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
 meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
 an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a
 man for coughing in the street because he hath
 wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
 didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
 his new doublet before easter with another for
 tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
 wilt tutor me from quarrelling

 benvolio who began this bloody fray

benvolio

 tybalt here slain whom romeos hand did slay
 romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
 how nice the quarrel was and urged withal
 your high displeasure all this uttered
 with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
 could not take truce with the unruly spleen
 of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
 with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast
 who all as hot turns deadly point to point
 and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
 cold death aside and with the other sends
 it back to tybalt whose dexterity
 retorts it romeo he cries aloud
 hold friends friends part and swifter than
 his tongue
 his agile arm beats down their fatal points
 and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
 an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
 of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
 but by and by comes back to romeo
 who had but newly entertaind revenge
 and to t they go like lightning for ere i
 could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
 and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
 this is the truth or let benvolio die

lady capulet

 he is a kinsman to the montague
 affection makes him false he speaks not true
 some twenty of them fought in this black strife
 and all those twenty could but kill one life
 i beg for justice which thou prince must give
 romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live

prince

 romeo slew him he slew mercutio
 who now the price of his dear blood doth owe

montague

 not romeo prince he was mercutios friend
 his fault concludes but what the law should end
 the life of tybalt

prince

 and for that offence
 immediately we do exile him hence
 i have an interest in your hates proceeding
 my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
 but ill amerce you with so strong a fine
 that you shall all repent the loss of mine
 i will be deaf to pleading and excuses
 nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
 therefore use none let romeo hence in haste
 else when hes found that hour is his last
 bear hence this body and attend our will
 mercy but murders pardoning those that kill

 if he be slain say i or if not no
 brief sounds determine of my weal or woe

nurse

 i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes
 god save the markhere on his manly breast
 a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
 pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
 all in goreblood i swounded at the sight

juliet

 o break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
 to prison eyes neer look on liberty
 vile earth to earth resign end motion here
 and thou and romeo press one heavy bier

nurse

 o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
 o courteous tybalt honest gentleman
 that ever i should live to see thee dead

juliet

 what storm is this that blows so contrary
 is romeo slaughterd and is tybalt dead
 my dearloved cousin and my dearer lord
 then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
 for who is living if those two are gone

nurse

 tybalt is gone and romeo banished
 romeo that killd him he is banished

juliet

 o god did romeos hand shed tybalts blood

nurse

 it did it did alas the day it did

juliet

 o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
 did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
 beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
 dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
 despised substance of divinest show
 just opposite to what thou justly seemst
 a damned saint an honourable villain
 o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
 when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
 in moral paradise of such sweet flesh
 was ever book containing such vile matter
 so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell
 in such a gorgeous palace

nurse

 theres no trust
 no faith no honesty in men all perjured
 all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
 ah wheres my man give me some aqua vitae
 these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
 shame come to romeo

juliet

 blisterd be thy tongue
 for such a wish he was not born to shame
 upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
 for tis a throne where honour may be crownd
 sole monarch of the universal earth
 o what a beast was i to chide at him

nurse

 will you speak well of him that killd your cousin

juliet

 shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
 ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
 when i thy threehours wife have mangled it
 but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
 that villain cousin would have killd my husband
 back foolish tears back to your native spring
 your tributary drops belong to woe
 which you mistaking offer up to joy
 my husband lives that tybalt would have slain
 and tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
 all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
 some word there was worser than tybalts death
 that murderd me i would forget it fain
 but o it presses to my memory
 like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
 tybalt is dead and romeobanished
 that banished that one word banished
 hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalts death
 was woe enough if it had ended there
 or if sour woe delights in fellowship
 and needly will be rankd with other griefs
 why followd not when she said tybalts dead
 thy father or thy mother nay or both
 which modern lamentations might have moved
 but with a rearward following tybalts death
 romeo is banished to speak that word
 is father mother tybalt romeo juliet
 all slain all dead romeo is banished
 there is no end no limit measure bound
 in that words death no words can that woe sound
 where is my father and my mother nurse

nurse

 weeping and wailing over tybalts corse
 will you go to them i will bring you thither

juliet

 wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent
 when theirs are dry for romeos banishment
 take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled
 both you and i for romeo is exiled
 he made you for a highway to my bed
 but i a maid die maidenwidowed
 come cords come nurse ill to my weddingbed
 and death not romeo take my maidenhead

nurse

 affliction is enamourd of thy parts
 and thou art wedded to calamity

 enter romeo

romeo

 father what news what is the princes doom
 what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
 that i yet know not

friar laurence

 too familiar
 is my dear son with such sour company
 i bring thee tidings of the princes doom

romeo

 what less than doomsday is the princes doom

friar laurence

 a gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
 not bodys death but bodys banishment

romeo

 ha banishment be merciful say death
 for exile hath more terror in his look
 much more than death do not say banishment

friar laurence

 hence from verona art thou banished
 be patient for the world is broad and wide

romeo

 there is no world without verona walls
 but purgatory torture hell itself
 hencebanished is banishd from the world
 and worlds exile is death then banished
 is death mistermd calling death banishment
 thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe
 and smilest upon the stroke that murders me

friar laurence

 o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
 thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
 taking thy part hath rushd aside the law
 and turnd that black word death to banishment
 this is dear mercy and thou seest it not

romeo

 tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
 where juliet lives and every cat and dog
 and little mouse every unworthy thing
 live here in heaven and may look on her
 but romeo may not more validity
 more honourable state more courtship lives
 in carrionflies than romeo they my seize
 on the white wonder of dear juliets hand
 and steal immortal blessing from her lips
 who even in pure and vestal modesty
 still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
 but romeo may not he is banished
 flies may do this but i from this must fly
 they are free men but i am banished
 and sayst thou yet that exile is not death
 hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
 no sudden mean of death though neer so mean
 but banished to kill mebanished
 o friar the damned use that word in hell
 howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
 being a divine a ghostly confessor
 a sinabsolver and my friend professd
 to mangle me with that word banished

friar laurence

 thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word

romeo

 o thou wilt speak again of banishment

friar laurence

 ill give thee armour to keep off that word
 adversitys sweet milk philosophy
 to comfort thee though thou art banished

romeo

 yet banished hang up philosophy
 unless philosophy can make a juliet
 displant a town reverse a princes doom
 it helps not it prevails not talk no more

friar laurence

 o then i see that madmen have no ears

romeo

 how should they when that wise men have no eyes

friar laurence

 let me dispute with thee of thy estate

romeo

 thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
 wert thou as young as i juliet thy love
 an hour but married tybalt murdered
 doting like me and like me banished
 then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
 and fall upon the ground as i do now
 taking the measure of an unmade grave

 knocking within

friar laurence

 arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself

romeo

 mistlike infold me from the search of eyes

nurse

 ah sir ah sir well deaths the end of all

romeo

 spakest thou of juliet how is it with her
 doth she not think me an old murderer
 now i have staind the childhood of our joy
 with blood removed but little from her own
 where is she and how doth she and what says
 my conceald lady to our cancelld love

nurse

 o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
 and now falls on her bed and then starts up
 and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries
 and then down falls again

romeo

 as if that name
 shot from the deadly level of a gun
 did murder her as that names cursed hand
 murderd her kinsman o tell me friar tell me
 in what vile part of this anatomy
 doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
 the hateful mansion

 drawing his sword

friar laurence

 hold thy desperate hand
 art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
 thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
 the unreasonable fury of a beast
 unseemly woman in a seeming man
 or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
 thou hast amazed me by my holy order
 i thought thy disposition better temperd
 hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
 and stay thy lady too that lives in thee
 by doing damned hate upon thyself
 why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
 since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
 in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
 fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
 which like a usurer aboundst in all
 and usest none in that true use indeed
 which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
 thy noble shape is but a form of wax
 digressing from the valour of a man
 thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
 killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
 thy wit that ornament to shape and love
 misshapen in the conduct of them both
 like powder in a skitless soldiers flask
 is set afire by thine own ignorance
 and thou dismemberd with thine own defence
 what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive
 for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
 there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee
 but thou slewst tybalt there are thou happy too
 the law that threatend death becomes thy friend
 and turns it to exile there art thou happy
 a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back
 happiness courts thee in her best array
 but like a misbehaved and sullen wench
 thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
 take heed take heed for such die miserable
 go get thee to thy love as was decreed
 ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
 but look thou stay not till the watch be set
 for then thou canst not pass to mantua
 where thou shalt live till we can find a time
 to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
 beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
 with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
 than thou wentst forth in lamentation
 go before nurse commend me to thy lady
 and bid her hasten all the house to bed
 which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
 romeo is coming

nurse

 o lord i could have stayd here all the night
 to hear good counsel o what learning is
 my lord ill tell my lady you will come

friar laurence

 go hence good night and here stands all your state
 either be gone before the watch be set
 or by the break of day disguised from hence
 sojourn in mantua ill find out your man
 and he shall signify from time to time
 every good hap to you that chances here
 give me thy hand tis late farewell good night

 wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
 it was the nightingale and not the lark
 that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
 nightly she sings on yon pomegranatetree
 believe me love it was the nightingale

romeo

 it was the lark the herald of the morn
 no nightingale look love what envious streaks
 do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
 nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
 stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
 i must be gone and live or stay and die

juliet

 yon light is not daylight i know it i
 it is some meteor that the sun exhales
 to be to thee this night a torchbearer
 and light thee on thy way to mantua
 therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone

romeo

 let me be taen let me be put to death
 i am content so thou wilt have it so
 ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye
 tis but the pale reflex of cynthias brow
 nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
 the vaulty heaven so high above our heads
 i have more care to stay than will to go
 come death and welcome juliet wills it so
 how ist my soul lets talk it is not day

juliet

 it is it is hie hence be gone away
 it is the lark that sings so out of tune
 straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
 some say the lark makes sweet division
 this doth not so for she divideth us
 some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
 o now i would they had changed voices too
 since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
 hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
 o now be gone more light and light it grows

 but much of grief shows still some want of wit

juliet

 yet let me weep for such a feeling loss

lady capulet

 so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
 which you weep for

juliet

 feeling so the loss
 cannot choose but ever weep the friend

lady capulet

 well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
 as that the villain lives which slaughterd him

juliet

 what villain madam

lady capulet

 that same villain romeo

juliet

 [aside] villain and he be many miles asunder
 god pardon him i do with all my heart
 and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart

lady capulet

 that is because the traitor murderer lives

juliet

 ay madam from the reach of these my hands
 would none but i might venge my cousins death

lady capulet

 we will have vengeance for it fear thou not
 then weep no more ill send to one in mantua
 where that same banishd runagate doth live
 shall give him such an unaccustomd dram
 that he shall soon keep tybalt company
 and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied

juliet

 indeed i never shall be satisfied
 with romeo till i behold himdead
 is my poor heart for a kinsman vexd
 madam if you could find out but a man
 to bear a poison i would temper it
 that romeo should upon receipt thereof
 soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors
 to hear him named and cannot come to him
 to wreak the love i bore my cousin
 upon his body that slaughterd him

lady capulet

 find thou the means and ill find such a man
 but now ill tell thee joyful tidings girl

juliet

 and joy comes well in such a needy time
 what are they i beseech your ladyship

 the gallant young and noble gentleman
 the county paris at saint peters church
 shall happily make thee there a joyful bride

juliet

 i wonder at this haste that i must wed
 ere he that should be husband comes to woo
 i pray you tell my lord and father madam
 i will not marry yet and when i do i swear
 it shall be romeo whom you know i hate
 rather than paris these are news indeed

 for still thy eyes which i may call the sea

 sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
 who raging with thy tears and they with them
 without a sudden calm will overset
 thy tempesttossed body how now wife

 unworthy as she is that we have wrought
 so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom

 o godo nurse how shall this be prevented

 alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
 upon so soft a subject as myself
 what sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy
 some comfort nurse

nurse

 faith here it is
 romeo is banishd and all the world to nothing
 that he dares neer come back to challenge you

 then since the case so stands as now it doth
 i think it best you married with the county
 o hes a lovely gentleman
 romeos a dishclout to him an eagle madam
 hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
 as paris hath beshrew my very heart

 for it excels your first or if it did not
 your first is dead or twere as good he were
 as living here and you no use of him

juliet

 speakest thou from thy heart

nurse

friar laurence

 you say you do not know the ladys mind
 uneven is the course i like it not

paris

 immoderately she weeps for tybalts death
 and therefore have i little talkd of love
 for venus smiles not in a house of tears
 now sir her father counts it dangerous
 that she doth give her sorrow so much sway
 and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
 to stop the inundation of her tears
 which too much minded by herself alone
 may be put from her by society
 now do you know the reason of this haste

juliet

 what must be shall be

friar laurence

 thats a certain text

paris

 come you to make confession to this father

juliet

 to answer that i should confess to you

paris

 do not deny to him that you love me

juliet

 i will confess to you that i love him

paris

 so will ye i am sure that you love me

juliet

 if i do so it will be of more price
 being spoke behind your back than to your face

paris

 poor soul thy face is much abused with tears

juliet

 the tears have got small victory by that
 for it was bad enough before their spite

paris

 thou wrongst it more than tears with that report

juliet

 that is no slander sir which is a truth
 and what i spake i spake it to my face

paris

 thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it

juliet

 it may be so for it is not mine own
 are you at leisure holy father now
 or shall i come to you at evening mass

friar laurence

 my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
 my lord we must entreat the time alone

paris

 god shield i should disturb devotion
 juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye
 till then adieu and keep this holy kiss

 exit

juliet

 o shut the door and when thou hast done so
 come weep with me past hope past cure past help

friar laurence

 ah juliet i already know thy grief
 it strains me past the compass of my wits
 i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
 on thursday next be married to this county

juliet

 tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
 unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
 if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
 do thou but call my resolution wise
 and with this knife ill help it presently
 god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands
 and ere this hand by thee to romeo seald
 shall be the label to another deed
 or my true heart with treacherous revolt
 turn to another this shall slay them both
 therefore out of thy longexperienced time
 give me some present counsel or behold
 twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
 shall play the umpire arbitrating that
 which the commission of thy years and art
 could to no issue of true honour bring
 be not so long to speak i long to die
 if what thou speakst speak not of remedy

friar laurence

 hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope
 which craves as desperate an execution
 as that is desperate which we would prevent
 if rather than to marry county paris
 thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
 then is it likely thou wilt undertake
 a thing like death to chide away this shame
 that copest with death himself to scape from it
 and if thou darest ill give thee remedy

juliet

 o bid me leap rather than marry paris
 from off the battlements of yonder tower
 or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
 where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
 or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse
 oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
 with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
 or bid me go into a newmade grave
 and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
 things that to hear them told have made me tremble
 and i will do it without fear or doubt
 to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love

friar laurence

 hold then go home be merry give consent
 to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow
 tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
 let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
 take thou this vial being then in bed
 and this distilled liquor drink thou off
 when presently through all thy veins shall run
 a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
 shall keep his native progress but surcease
 no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
 the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
 to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
 like death when he shuts up the day of life
 each part deprived of supple government
 shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
 and in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death
 thou shalt continue two and forty hours
 and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
 now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
 to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
 then as the manner of our country is
 in thy best robes uncoverd on the bier
 thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
 where all the kindred of the capulets lie
 in the mean time against thou shalt awake
 shall romeo by my letters know our drift
 and hither shall he come and he and i
 will watch thy waking and that very night
 shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
 and this shall free thee from this present shame
 if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
 abate thy valour in the acting it

juliet

 give me give me o tell not me of fear

friar laurence

 hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
 in this resolve ill send a friar with speed
 to mantua with my letters to thy lord

juliet

 love give me strength and strength shall help afford
 farewell dear father

 my dismal scene i needs must act alone
 come vial
 what if this mixture do not work at all
 shall i be married then tomorrow morning
 no no this shall forbid it lie thou there

 laying down her dagger

 what if it be a poison which the friar
 subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
 lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
 because he married me before to romeo
 i fear it is and yet methinks it should not
 for he hath still been tried a holy man
 how if when i am laid into the tomb
 i wake before the time that romeo
 come to redeem me theres a fearful point
 shall i not then be stifled in the vault
 to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
 and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
 or if i live is it not very like
 the horrible conceit of death and night
 together with the terror of the place
 as in a vault an ancient receptacle
 where for these many hundred years the bones
 of all my buried ancestors are packed
 where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
 lies festering in his shroud where as they say
 at some hours in the night spirits resort
 alack alack is it not like that i
 so early waking what with loathsome smells
 and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
 that living mortals hearing them run mad
 o if i wake shall i not be distraught
 environed with all these hideous fears
 and madly play with my forefathers joints
 and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
 and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
 as with a club dash out my desperate brains
 o look methinks i see my cousins ghost
 seeking out romeo that did spit his body
 upon a rapiers point stay tybalt stay
 romeo i come this do i drink to thee

 my dreams presage some joyful news at hand
 my bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
 and all this day an unaccustomd spirit
 lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
 i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
 strange dream that gives a dead man leave
 to think
 and breathed such life with kisses in my lips
 that i revived and was an emperor
 ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
 when but loves shadows are so rich in joy

 then she is well and nothing can be ill
 her body sleeps in capels monument
 and her immortal part with angels lives
 i saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
 and presently took post to tell it you
 o pardon me for bringing these ill news
 since you did leave it for my office sir

 is it even so then i defy you stars
 thou knowst my lodging get me ink and paper
 and hire posthorses i will hence tonight

 i do beseech you sir have patience
 your looks are pale and wild and do import
 some misadventure

 and hire those horses ill be with thee straight

 exit balthasar

 well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
 lets see for means o mischief thou art swift
 to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
 i do remember an apothecary
 and hereabouts he dwellswhich late i noted
 in tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows
 culling of simples meagre were his looks
 sharp misery had worn him to the bones
 and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
 an alligator stuffd and other skins
 of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
 a beggarly account of empty boxes
 green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
 remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
 were thinly scatterd to make up a show
 noting this penury to myself i said
 an if a man did need a poison now
 whose sale is present death in mantua
 here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
 o this same thought did but forerun my need
 and this same needy man must sell it me
 as i remember this should be the house
 being holiday the beggars shop is shut
 what ho apothecary

 enter apothecary

apothecary

 who calls so loud

romeo

 come hither man i see that thou art poor
 hold there is forty ducats let me have
 a dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
 as will disperse itself through all the veins
 that the lifeweary taker may fall dead
 and that the trunk may be discharged of breath
 as violently as hasty powder fired
 doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb

apothecary

 such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law
 is death to any he that utters them

romeo

 art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
 and fearst to die famine is in thy cheeks
 need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
 contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
 the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
 the world affords no law to make thee rich
 then be not poor but break it and take this

apothecary

 my poverty but not my will consents

romeo

 i pay thy poverty and not thy will

apothecary

 put this in any liquid thing you will
 and drink it off and if you had the strength
 of twenty men it would dispatch you straight

romeo

 there is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
 doing more murders in this loathsome world
 than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
 i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
 farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
 come cordial and not poison go with me
 to juliets grave for there must i use thee

 holding thine ear close to the hollow ground

 but thou shalt hear it whistle then to me

 see thou deliver it to my lord and father
 give me the light upon thy life i charge thee
 whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof
 and do not interrupt me in my course
 why i descend into this bed of death
 is partly to behold my ladys face
 but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
 a precious ring a ring that i must use
 in dear employment therefore hence be gone
 but if thou jealous dost return to pry
 in what i further shall intend to do
 by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint
 and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
 the time and my intents are savagewild
 more fierce and more inexorable far
 than empty tigers or the roaring sea

 i will be gone sir and not trouble you

 so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that
 live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow

 in faith i will let me peruse this face
 mercutios kinsman noble county paris
 what said my man when my betossed soul
 did not attend him as we rode i think
 he told me paris should have married juliet
 said he not so or did i dream it so
 or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet
 to think it was so o give me thy hand
 one writ with me in sour misfortunes book
 ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
 a grave o no a lantern slaughterd youth
 for here lies juliet and her beauty makes
 this vault a feasting presence full of light
 death lie thou there by a dead man interrd

 laying paris in the tomb

 how oft when men are at the point of death
 have they been merry which their keepers call
 a lightning before death o how may i
 call this a lightning o my love my wife
 death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath
 hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
 thou art not conquerd beautys ensign yet
 is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
 and deaths pale flag is not advanced there
 tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
 o what more favour can i do to thee
 than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
 to sunder his that was thine enemy
 forgive me cousin ah dear juliet
 why art thou yet so fair shall i believe
 that unsubstantial death is amorous
 and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
 thee here in dark to be his paramour
 for fear of that i still will stay with thee
 and never from this palace of dim night
 depart again here here will i remain
 with worms that are thy chambermaids o here
 will i set up my everlasting rest
 and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
 from this worldwearied flesh eyes look your last
 arms take your last embrace and lips o you
 the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
 a dateless bargain to engrossing death
 come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
 thou desperate pilot now at once run on
 the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
 heres to my love

 drinks

 o true apothecary
 thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die

 that warns my old age to a sepulchre

 enter montague and others

prince

 come montague for thou art early up
 to see thy son and heir more early down

 grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath
 what further woe conspires against mine age

prince

 look and thou shalt see

montague

 o thou untaught what manners is in this
 to press before thy father to a grave

prince

 seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
 till we can clear these ambiguities
 and know their spring their head their
 true descent
 and then will i be general of your woes
 and lead you even to death meantime forbear
 and let mischance be slave to patience
 bring forth the parties of suspicion

friar laurence

 i am the greatest able to do least
 yet most suspected as the time and place
 doth make against me of this direful murder
 and here i stand both to impeach and purge
 myself condemned and myself excused

prince

 then say at once what thou dost know in this

friar laurence

 i will be brief for my short date of breath
 is not so long as is a tedious tale
 romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
 and she there dead that romeos faithful wife
 i married them and their stoln marriageday
 was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
 banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city
 for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined
 you to remove that siege of grief from her
 betrothd and would have married her perforce
 to county paris then comes she to me
 and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
 to rid her from this second marriage
 or in my cell there would she kill herself
 then gave i her so tutord by my art
 a sleeping potion which so took effect
 as i intended for it wrought on her
 the form of death meantime i writ to romeo
 that he should hither come as this dire night
 to help to take her from her borrowd grave
 being the time the potions force should cease
 but he which bore my letter friar john
 was stayd by accident and yesternight
 returnd my letter back then all alone
 at the prefixed hour of her waking
 came i to take her from her kindreds vault
 meaning to keep her closely at my cell
 till i conveniently could send to romeo
 but when i came some minute ere the time
 of her awaking here untimely lay
 the noble paris and true romeo dead
 she wakes and i entreated her come forth
 and bear this work of heaven with patience
 but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
 and she too desperate would not go with me
 but as it seems did violence on herself
 all this i know and to the marriage
 her nurse is privy and if aught in this
 miscarried by my fault let my old life
 be sacrificed some hour before his time
 unto the rigour of severest law

prince

 we still have known thee for a holy man
 wheres romeos man what can he say in this

balthasar

 i brought my master news of juliets death
 and then in post he came from mantua
 to this same place to this same monument
 this letter he early bid me give his father
 and threatened me with death going in the vault
 i departed not and left him there

prince

 give me the letter i will look on it
 where is the countys page that raised the watch
 sirrah what made your master in this place

page

 he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
 and bid me stand aloof and so i did
 anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
 and by and by my master drew on him
 and then i ran away to call the watch

prince

 this letter doth make good the friars words
 their course of love the tidings of her death
 and here he writes that he did buy a poison
 of a poor pothecary and therewithal
 came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
 where be these enemies capulet montague
 see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
 that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
 and i for winking at your discords too
 have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd

capulet

 o brother montague give me thy hand
 this is my daughters jointure for no more
 can i demand

montague

 but i can give thee more
 for i will raise her statue in pure gold
 that while verona by that name is known
 there shall no figure at such rate be set
 as that of true and faithful juliet

capulet

 as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie
 poor sacrifices of our enmity

prince

 a glooming peace this morning with it brings
 the sun for sorrow will not show his head
 go hence to have more talk of these sad things
 some shall be pardond and some punished
 for never was a story of more woe
 than this of juliet and her romeo

 exeunt
